                As the revenues from online sales continued to grow significantly researchers identified different types 
                of online shoppers, Rohm & Swaninathan identified four categories and named them "convenience shoppers, 
                variety seekers, balanced buyers, and store-oriented shoppers". They focused on shopping motivations and
                found that the variety of products available and the perceived convenience of the buying online 
                experience were significant motivating factors. This was different for offline shoppers, who were more
                motivated by time saving and recreational motives.

                The emergence of online shopping as we know today developed with the emergence of the Internet.
                Initially, this platform only functioned as an advertising tool for companies, providing information 
                about its products. It quickly moved on from this simple utility to actual online shopping transaction
                due to the development of interactive Web pages and secure transmissions.

                <br>

                Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a 
                transaction. Generally, higher levels of education and personal income correspond to more favorable 
                perceptions of shopping online. Increased exposure to technology also increases the probability of
                 developing favorable attitudes towards new shopping channels.
